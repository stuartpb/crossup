# crossup

A system for generating cross-platform package setup routines

This was originally called "nixup", but that made it sound like it was tied to Nix (which I actually hadn't even heard of when I originally started the project).

Anyway, its new goal is focused on cross-platform consolidation, to be implemented as a script-generating webapp.
